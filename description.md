MyExtension can be used as a template for building new extensions, it includes a bunch of functions that can be edited/deleted as you need them.

This is a longform description that will be used in the advanced description when users click on the "more" button on the extension cards.

Adding some bullets is nice covering:

- Functionality
- Use cases

...and some other text about just how great this etension is.
